# react-first-attempts
I created this landing page as an attempt from me to solidify my understanding of React and I am willing to came back to it in the future to enhance it further.
That was all becuase I'm somehow eager to take a more challenging project to hone my skills and take my coding craft to another level. 
This tiny project built with some basic react coding.
BTW you need to install ReactJS if you choice to push these files.
